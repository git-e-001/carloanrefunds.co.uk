        <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Making Your Claim</b><br>
        <span>
            When you instruct and authorise us to make a claim on your behalf you agree to Redbridge Finance Limited
            contacting the 3rd parties that We need to in order to make and manage that claim. You agree to Redbridge
            Finance Limited sharing with them the information you have provided to Redbridge Finance Limited and also
            collecting and processing the information we receive from them.
            <br>
            During the process, we will need to make decisions on the best way to proceed and you give your authority
            for
            Redbridge Finance Limited to use our skill and judgement to make such decisions on Your behalf.
        </span>
        <br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Additional Credit<br></b>
        <span> Unless you have specifically provided details of agreements that You DO NOT want Us to make a claim on, if
            during the course of a claim, the lender reveals other credit that you have taken with them, We may, at our
            discretion, extend the claim to cover these. In such circumstances, these loans will be covered by this
            agreement and the respective success fees will be payable.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Your Obligations<br></b>:START-INDENTATION<br>a. During the claim, you will be asked to provide Redbridge
        Finance Limited with information about you, your circumstances and your borrowings. You must ensure that this
        information is accurate and honest. Knowingly providing fraudulent or incorrect information at any time may
        jeopardise your claim and will put you in breach of this agreement.<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must, at the start of
        the claim, provide Redbridge Finance Limited with all documents, including those in electronic forms such as
        emails or computer files, in your possession that is relevant to the claim (You will be asked to confirm this
        when signing this document).<br>c.&nbsp;You will read any documentation that Redbridge Finance Limited, or the
        lender, sends you and retain these documents in your safekeeping.<br>d.&nbsp;You will advise Redbridge Finance
        Limited immediately of any changes to the details you have provided or if you realise that information
        previously provided has changed or contains errors.<br>e. If an offer of compensation is sent directly to You,
        You will notify Redbridge Finance Limited of this within 5 days.<br>f. If we inform you that a lender has
        written to you directly and are refusing to send us a copy, you will, on request, forward us a copy within 7
        days of us asking you.<br>g. You agree unless a legal or statutory requirement dictates otherwise, to receive
        all written communications from Redbridge Finance Limited by email to the email address supplied by You. We may
        also use the post to send such communications.
        too.<br>h. You will not, at any time throughout the term of this agreement, withdraw from any lender our
        authority to act on your behalf and/or work with them, without first cancelling this agreement in accordance
        with clause 9.<br>:END-INDENTATION
    </li>
    <li><b>Our Obligations<br></b>:START-INDENTATION<br>a.&nbsp;We will manage Your claim with reasonable care and
        diligence to ensure that where there has been a case of irresponsible lending, Redbridge Finance Limited
        maximise the possibility of You getting what you are entitled to.<br>b. We will assist You to fill in any
        necessary forms and where appropriate check the details You have provided, however We will NOT “coach” You on
        how to fill in these in order to maximise the claim value where this would result in inaccurate information
        being entered. All answer, statements or declarations are Your responsibility.<br>c. We will keep You updated on
        the progress of Your claim as it progresses.<br>d. If We do not feel that the claim has sufficient merit to be
        continued We will advise You of this. We will then release this loan from this agreement to allow You to proceed
        with the claim yourself if you wish. (Please note, if We do this only that loan is released from this agreement
        – any other loans not notified under this clause will still be pursued by Us and a success fee is payable.)<br>e.
        We have an obligation to ensure that Redbridge Finance Limited avoid any conflicts of interest. We, therefore,
        have the right to refuse to take on a claim, or where a claim has been started, terminate this agreement, if we
        suspect that this would be the case.<br>:END-INDENTATION<br></li>
    <li><b>Payment - No Win No Fee</b><br>All claims are undertaken on a No Win - No Fee (NWNF) basis.

        Where You refuse to accept a compensation offer You will still be liable for our fees including if the case is

        the FOS have reviewed the case you will still be liable for rur success fee.
        <br>
        You must notify Redbridge Finance Limited within 5 days of knowing that payment is going to be made directly to
        your account. We will provide You with an invoice which must be paid within 5 days of receipt of payment from
        the lender. If an invoice remains unpaid after 5 days an arrears fee of £20.00 per month will be payable.
        <br>
        If we are made aware or suspect, that a final response to a complaint has been issued, and the lender refuses to
        send us a copy, we will ask you to supply this in accordance with clause 6h of this agreement. If you refuse to
        do this we will assume that an offer of redress has been made. As we will not know the value of the redress
        offered we will not be able to calculate our fees. In these cases, we will calculate our fees based on the
        average of all offers received from that lender over the preceding 12 months. An invoice will be raised and will
        become payable within 5 days. If you subsequently send us a copy of the final response received from the lender
        we will recalculate our fees based on the actual redress offered. An admin fee of £100 plus vat will be charged
        in this situation.

        However, if you cancel after two weeks without providing an acceptable reason we will charge for time spent on
        your case.If you cancel after the case has been submitted to the FOS, and no further input is required from
        you, you will still have to pay our fees calculated on any award recommended by the FOS.
